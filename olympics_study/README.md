                                                     #Open-ended Capstone Project Proposal 

                                          How sports in Olympics Athlete events have evolved in 120 years

Problem statement formation:

To determine the reasons and the trend of how the events in Olympics have evolved based on player’s metrics, the countries’ infrastructure and economy, different seasons, and each team’s participation in numbers of sports.  

Context:

The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The dataset used in this project, consists of Olympics data of over a century, from the year 1896 to 2016. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Criteria for success:

Studying this dataset will help us understand the patterns followed in the games of Olympics, patterns of the most successful athletes and countries in their Olympics journey and much more! This project will help you understand every detail and information that you would want to know in the Olympics using statistical approach and at the same time help you enhance our skills as a Data Scientist.

 Scopes of solution space:

•	To have a fair view of every player’s body measurement metrics. <br>
•	How the body metrics is dependent to the sportsperson’s performance? <br>
•	Are the country’s GDP and resources affects the sportsperson’s performance and how? <br>
